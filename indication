Using my camera:
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-uvc-camera
rosrun uvc_camera uvc_camera_node

To see our camera image: 
rqt_image_view

Calibrating it :
http://wiki.ros.org/camera_calibration/Tutorials/MonocularCalibration
(don't forget a squared chestboard)

We can then process it :
http://wiki.ros.org/image_proc

rosrun image_proc image_proc (in my case)

Then we take as input 
/image_rect_color or /image_rect_color/compressed
instead of 
/image_raw


after calibration my focal lenght is more or less 605 (my fl in x and y aren't exactly the same)
