## in controller
controller-python.py


here you have info about how to control the motors, the time, create and manipulate motions (in closeopenhand and in the loop part)

Don't hesitate to ask if you don't understand something, or if something is uncomplete. 

## In Motion
handLclose and HandLOpen.motion or shooT.motion (in your world, i erased it on this github) 

here you can see how to create your own motion. 

Warning: there is no motor feedback
